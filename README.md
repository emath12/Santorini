Santorini is a chess-like strategy game. I created this project as a demonstration of my understnding of Object Oriented Programming. It employs several standard design patterns, as well as
DS&A techniques like combination generation. See the UML diagram and design patterns write up for more info.

Rules:
- Each player, colored blue and white, starts with two workers.
- Workers can move either north, south, east, west, northwest, northeast, southeast, or southwest. 
- Workers can build in any direction in any occupied square.
- The game is won when we build a tower of level 3 and get a worker on it.
- A tower of level 4 cannot have a worker moved onto it.
- Players can build onto a tower of any level, but may only move up one level and down any number of levels.
